# Chain Of Responsibility
Chain of Responsibility is behavioral design pattern that allows passing request along the chain of potential handlers until one of them handles request.

The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request without coupling sender class to the concrete classes of the receivers. The chain can be composed dynamically at runtime with any handler that follows a standard handler interface.

## Applicability
- Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.
- Use the pattern when itâ€™s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.
- Use the CoR pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime.

## Pros
- You can control the order of request handling.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform operations.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new handlers into the app without breaking the existing client code.
## Cons
- Some requests may end up unhandled.
