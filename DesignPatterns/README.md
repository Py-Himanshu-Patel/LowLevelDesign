# Design Patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

We need design patterns to ensure that out work is **consistent, reliable** and **understandable**. For easy understanding refer [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog)

## Creational Patterns
Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

1. [Singleton](Singleton/README.md)
2. Prototype - [External Link](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
3. [Factory Method](FactoryPattern/README.md)
4. [Builder](BuilderPattern/README.md)
5. [Abstract Factory](AbstractFactoryPattern/README.md)

## Structural Patterns
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1. Chain of responsibility
2. Iterator
3. Memento
4. State
5. Template Method
6. Command
7. Mediator
8. Observer
9. Strategy
10. Visitor
