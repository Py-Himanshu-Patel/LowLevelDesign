# Singleton Pattern

**Classification**: Creational

This pattern is used for creation of object. Infact Singleton enfore that class must have only one object. This provide global point of access. Also class is reponsible for its one intance. Also provide **lazy** instantiation is object is costly to instantiate or less likely to use.

`object.__dict__`  
A dictionary or other mapping object used to store an objectâ€™s (writable) attributes.

`object.__call__(self[, args...])`  
Called when the instance is **called** as a function; if this method is defined, `x(arg1, arg2, ...)` roughly translates to `type(x).__call__(x, arg1, ...)`.

Lets understand it via an example

```python
>>> class MyClass:
...     class_attribute = "iamclass"
... 
>>> a = MyClass()
>>> a.__dict__
{} 
>>> a.class_attribute
'iamclass'
>>> a.obj_attribute = "iamobj"
>>> a.obj_attribute
'iamobj'
>>> a.__dict__
{'obj_attribute': 'iamobj'}
```

## Simple Example

```python
class Singleton:
    ans = None

    @staticmethod
    def instance():
        if '_instance' not in Singleton.__dict__:
            Singleton._instance = Singleton()
        return Singleton._instance

s1 = Singleton.instance()
s2 = Singleton.instance()
s1.ans = 10

assert s1 is s2
assert s1.ans == s2.ans

print("Test Passed")
```

While using `@staticmethod` we dont pass `self` parameter to method.

## Classic Example : Logger

A more classic example is of Logger which need only one instance of class for execution and loggin all the required activities.

```python
import datetime

class Logger:
    log_file = None

    @staticmethod
    def instance():
        if '_instance' not in Logger.__dict__:
            Logger._instance = Logger()
        return Logger._instance

    def open_log(self, path):
        self.log_file = open(path, mode='w')
        self.log_file.writelines('\n')

    def write_log(self, log_record):
        now = str(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m-%d-%Y, %H:%M:%S"))
        record = f"{now}: {log_record}"
        self.log_file.writelines(record)
    
    def close_log(self):
        self.log_file.close()


logger = Logger()
logger.open_log('MyLog.log')
logger.write_log('Logger with classic Singleton pattern')
logger.close_log()

with open('MyLog.log', 'r') as log:
    for line in log:
        print(line)
```

Singleton is called **antipattern** because some of the cons.

- **Violates Single Responsiblity Priciple**: Same logger class is making a file connection and maintaining it.

- **Non-Standard class access**: To get instance we must know the class is singleton and then use `_instance` method to get already instantiated object.

- **Testing**: They make unit testing very hard. They introduce global state to the application. The problem is that you cannot completely isolate classes dependent on singletons. Difficult to make mockups.

## Base Class Example : Fix Single Responsiblity Problem

Building a base class for all singleton.

Whenever a class is instantiated `__new__` and `__init__` methods are called. `__new__` method will be called when an object is created and `__init__` method will be called to initialize the object.

```python
class class_name:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        statements
        .
        .
        return super(class_name, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
```

```python
class MyClass:
    def __new__(cls):
        print("Making new object")
        return super(MyClass, cls).__new__(cls)

    def __init__(self):
        print("Initializing new object")

obj = MyClass()
print('-- obj created --')

# Making new object
# Initializing new object
# -- obj created --
```

### Logger with Base Singleton class

```python
# singleton_baseclass.py

import datetime

class Singleton:
    _instances = {}     # dict([cls, instance])

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

# from singleton_baseclass import Singleton

class Logger(Singleton):
    log_file = None

    # need for open file method is removed
    def __init__(self, path):
        if not self.log_file:
            self.log_file = open(path, 'w')
    
    def write_log(self, log_record):
        now = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m-%d-%Y, %H:%M:%S")
        record = f"{now}: {log_record}"
        self.log_file.writelines(record + "\n")

    def close_log(self):
        if self.log_file:
            self.log_file.close()
            self.log_file = None

# need for Logger.instance() is removed
logger1 = Logger('MyLog2.log')
logger1.write_log('First Line of log')
logger2 = Logger('SameLogFile.log')
logger2.write_log('Second Line of log')
logger1.close_log()
logger2.close_log()


with open('MyLog2.log', 'r') as log:
    for line in log:
        print(line)
```

In `MyLog2.log`. Notice `SameLogFile.log` is not even created as long as first object of Logger is present.

```text
06-01-2021, 10:20:20: First Line of log
06-01-2021, 10:20:20: Second Line of log
```

## Meta Class Example : Class's class

Each class is an instance of its metaclass. A class can control it's instances. Hence we use a meta class to control all the instance of its subclass they can create a new instance only it there do not exists one already.

```python
import datetime

class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

# from singleton_metaclass import Singleton

class Logger(metaclass=Singleton):
    log_file = None

    # need for open file method is removed
    def __init__(self, path):
        if not self.log_file:
            self.log_file = open(path, 'w')

    def write_log(self, log_record):
        now = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m-%d-%Y, %H:%M:%S")
        record = f"{now}: {log_record}"
        self.log_file.writelines(record)

    def close_log(self):
        if self.log_file:
            self.log_file.close()
            self.log_file = None


logger1 = Logger('MyLog3.log')
logger1.write_log('First Line of log')
logger2 = Logger('SameLogFile.log')
logger2.write_log('Second Line of log')
logger1.close_log()
logger2.close_log()


with open('MyLog2.log', 'r') as log:
    for line in log:
        print(line)
```

## Monostate Example: Maintain state of all instances

It maintains a dictionary maintaining a single state for all instances.

```python
import datetime

# it maintains a dictionary maintaining a single state for all instances
class MonoState(object):
    _state = {}

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        # create a new instance
        self = super().__new__(cls)	
        # new instance have same properties as prev instance
        self.__dict__ = cls._state
        # return new instance
        return self

# from singleton_monostate import MonoState

class Logger(MonoState):
    log_file = None

    # need for open file method is removed
    def __init__(self, path):
        if not self.log_file:
            self.log_file = open(path, 'w')

    def write_log(self, log_record):
        now = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m-%d-%Y, %H:%M:%S")
        record = f"{now}: {log_record}"
        self.log_file.writelines(record)

    def close_log(self):
        if self.log_file:
            self.log_file.close()
            self.log_file = None


logger1 = Logger('MyLog4.log')
logger1.write_log('First Line of log')
logger2 = Logger('MyLog4_2.log')
logger2.write_log('Second Line of log')
logger1.close_log()
logger2.close_log()


with open('MyLog4.log', 'r') as log:
    for line in log:
        print(line)
```

To better understand MonoState

```python
>>> c = MonoState()
>>> c.__dict__
{}
>>> c.art1 = "Hello"
>>> c.__dict__
{'art1': 'Hello'} 
>>> d = MonoState()
>>> d.__dict__
{'art1': 'Hello'}
```

## Summary

- Allow creation of single object by not allowing creation of new object or return same instance whenever class is called to prevent creation of new instances.

- It is different than static class as all attributes are class level attributes and can be accessed directly from class. Thus static class do not have any instances.

- Base class or Meta class method can be used to create various instances of same class but all those are effectively same.
